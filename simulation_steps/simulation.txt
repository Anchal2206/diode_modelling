Simulation Steps for Diode Reverse Recovery and Breakdown Analysis
==================================================================

1. Compile the Verilog-A file (`.va`) using the chosen simulator and check for any syntactical errors.

2. Open a new schematic window within the simulation environment.

3. Navigate to the Components section and select the compiled C++ model from the Devices library.

4. Load the compiled `.va` file to define the device model to be simulated.

5. Construct the circuit by placing:
      - A voltage source (DC or Pulse)
      - Voltage and current probes
      - Ground connection
      - Necessary wiring between components

6. Set up a DC Sweep simulation:
      - Use this to plot the diode's I-V characteristic (current vs. voltage)

7. Set up a Transient simulation:
      - Use a rectangular voltage pulse input
      - Observe reverse recovery current characteristics over time
      - Analyze diode storage and transition behavior

8. Perform a Parameter Sweep along with Transient simulation:
      - Vary intrinsic layer thickness (`d`) and doping concentration (`Nd`)
      - Measure and compare breakdown voltage (`Vbr`) under different conditions

9. Export graph data as `.csv` files:
      - Plot `Vbr vs. Nd` and `Vbr vs. d` using external tools (e.g., Python/Excel)

10. Repeat parameter sweep to analyze Transit Time variation:
        - Plot `Transit Time vs. Nd` and `Transit Time vs. d` for comparative study

Notes:
=====
- Ensure pulse width, rise/fall times, and biasing are configured according to the desired time resolution.
- Simulation accuracy depends on timestep settings and model parameter tuning.
- Use plotting tools within the simulator or export data for external analysis.
